    role: 'Junior frontend developer',
    info: `I am a junior frontend developer with a background in foreign languages, although I have never worked in that field. Instead, I spent 20 years as an entrepreneur in the trade industry. This experience has made me organized, sociable, and adept at managing conflict situations. I am diligent, punctual, and perhaps even a bit pedantic, as I love maintaining order in every detail.
          After many years in trade, I sought novelty, new knowledge, and new experiences. I found myself drawn to the magic of JavaScript, the excitement of seeing lines of code transform into something visible, beautiful, and understandable. This passion led me to change my profession and pursue a career in frontend development.`,
