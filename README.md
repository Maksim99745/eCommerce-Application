# eCommerce Application

Educational project presented as a demo version of an online shop. The task is focused on gaining knowledge of team development.

## Description

The e-Commerce application is being developed by a team of 3 developers over the course of 4 sprints using the Scrum methodology.
The application is a model of an online store that closely resembles reality.

Key pages in the application include:

- Login and Registration pages üñ•Ô∏è
- Main page üè†
- Catalog Product page üìã
- Detailed Product page üîé
- User Profile page üë§
- Basket page üõí
- About Us page üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Project goals:

- Gain an understanding of team development and Scrum methodologies.
- Strengthen knowledge in TypeScript development and master the basics of React framework development.
- Master the basics of writing unit tests.
- Deepen experience in writing Single Page Application (SPA).

## Development server

Use `npm start` to run the development server using Vite

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. It will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## ESLint check

Run `npm run lint` to check for code style and potential errors in the `src/` directory, including TypeScript and TSX files (--ext ts,tsx). It also reports any unused disable directives (--report-unused-disable-directives) and sets the maximum number of warnings to 0 (--max-warnings 0), which means ESLint will treat warnings as errors. This script helps quickly identify code style issues and potential errors in the project

## ESLint fix issues

Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fixe ESLint errors and code style issues in the `src/` directory

## Check the production build

To check if the production build looks OK in your local environment run

```
npm run preview
```

It will run script `vite preview` to boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173.
_It is important to note that `vite preview` is intended for previewing the build locally and not meant as a production server._

## Prettier check

Run `npm run prettier` to check if your files in the `src/` directory are formatted. This will output a human-friendly message and a list of unformatted files, if any.
It will run the script, that is set to ignore unknown file types. Prettier will not attempt to check files with extensions that it does not recognize.

```
prettier --check --ignore-unknown src/
```

## Prettier fix issues

Run `npm run prettier:fix` to fix code formatting issues in the `src/` directory using Prettier. The `--ignore-unknown` flag is also used to instruct Prettier not to format files with extensions that it does not recognize.

## ESLint and Prettier fix issues

To make ESLint fix code style issues, and then format code using Prettier in the `src/` directory - use `npm run formatAll` It will run script:

```
npm run lint:fix && npm run prettier:fix
```

## Set up Git hooks

To automatically set up Git hooks for code linting and formatting, run the following command after installing project dependencies: `npm run prepare`

## TypeScript Type Checking

To perform TypeScript type checking without generating JavaScript files, run the following command:

```
npm run types-check
```

## Pre-Push Checks

To perform pre-push checks, ensuring code quality and consistency before pushing changes to the repository, run the command `npm run pre-push`

## Utilizing unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
